# Blackjack Console Game

This is a console-based implementation of the Blackjack card game written in Java. The game allows a player to play against a dealer in a game of Blackjack.

## Installation

To run the Blackjack game on your local machine, you will need to have Java installed. You can then clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

bash

`git clone https://github.com/luigimagdamit/cardgames.git` 

## Usage

To start the game, navigate to the `blackjack` directory and run the following command:

```
`java Main` 
```
This will start the game and prompt you to enter your name. Once you have entered your name, the game will begin. You will be dealt two cards and the dealer will be dealt one card face up.

You will then be prompted to choose whether to hit or stand. If you choose to hit, you will be dealt another card. If the value of your hand exceeds 21, you will bust and lose the game. If you choose to stand, the dealer will continue to draw cards until the value of their hand is at least 17. If the value of the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they will bust and you will win the game.

If the value of your hand is higher than the value of the dealer's hand and less than or equal to 21, you will win the game. If the value of the dealer's hand is higher than the value of your hand and less than or equal to 21, you will lose the game. If the value of both hands are equal, the game will end in a tie.
